      "Congradulations on graduating Minqi!\n\nYou're one of the most friendly and driven people I have ever met, and I know you're going to do great things in the future. I'm glad we learned Lion Dance at the same time and experienced all those happy  😊 and sad  🙁 and frustrating  😤 moments. It was great learning to stack with you as my stackee, and doing those stacks at Culture Show and O-Show.\n\nI can't wait to see what you do in the future,\n\nRobert Huang",

      "Minqi!!\n\nI think I've told you before that I think you're the most talented person I know, and that's been true since freshman year. From crying over Solver and helping me not fail physics, to sitting together in Psych, to hearing your adventures over dinners at Peko Peko & Tambers, you've continually amazed me with your grit and good humor.\n\nI don't think anyone could be more deserving of your successes than you. I'm also sure that moving off to this new chapter in your life is a tiny bit scary, but I'm so, so excited for you. You've worked so hard for this, and you're going to do amazing!\n\nWhen you're rich and famous, I will collect monies from having been your physics lab partner. Until then, please keep in touch!",

      "Congrats Minqi!! I'm so happy I got to know you through Lion dance! It's always great talking with you at practice and going around NY with you and our group was probably one of my favorite memories of freshman year. I still remember how many times you visited uniqlo and you being hooked on TikTok before it became big in America HAHA. Also, you were always a huge help in intermediate, which I appreciated so so much. I know things can be rough as a CS major, but honestly you're so hard-working and smart, I know you'll do great even after graduating :)\n\nWe'll miss you, come back and visit sometime if you're still in the States after graduation!! 💕",
