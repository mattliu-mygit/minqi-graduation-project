It's always great talking with you at practice and going around NY with you and our group was probably one of my favorite memories of freshman year. I still remember how many times you visited uniqlo and you being hooked on TikTok before it became big in America HAHA. Also, you were always a huge help in intermediate, which I appreciated so so much. I know things can be rough as a CS major, but honestly you're so hard-working and smart, I know you'll do great even after graduating :)",
